        <div class="section">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray tracing was invented as a way to render images with complex, high-quality light interactions. The simplest 
            implementations of ray tracers perform admirably when it comes to these interactions: they generate pixel-perfect shadows, reflection, 
            refraction, etc. But real life is not so pixel-perfect. To this end, many techniques have been devised in order to roughen up ray traced 
            images and lend them a sense of realism.
        
            <br><br>
        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such technique is photon mapping, invented by Henrik Jensen (of UC San Diego). Photon mapping aims to emulate
            the behavior of light more closely by creating photons at light sources and sending them around the scene, storing the interaction each
            photon has each time it bounces off a surface. Photon mapping can be used to create many different lighting effects, but I used it only for 
            <b>global illumination</b> and <b>caustics</b>.
        
            <br><br>
        
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Global illumination</b>, also called <b>indirect illumination</b>, refers to the light in a scene that is not 
            direct from a light source, i.e., it has bounced off at least one surface. In practice, this allows surfaces of varying reflectivity to 
            propagate light around a scene and change its color as it goes based on their surface color. Most noticeably, this results in color 
            bleeding between two adjacent surfaces. <b>Caustics</b> is the name for the effect by which refractive materials bend and refocus light, 
            creating patterns of less and more light (such as when you shine a light through a magnifying glass) on the underlying surfaces.

        <h4>Related Work</h4>
        
        <div class="section">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jensen was the originator of the technique and as such, his two listed papers here were my main resources. He
            describes the algorithms along with some recommended implementation techniques. He makes a lot of references to the Ward paper, and
            though that's for an optimization technique (irradiance caching; mentioned later) I have not implemented I still found the paper useful. 
            Lastly, Havran's paper was useful for another optimization technique (kd-trees) that I used heavily.

        <h4>Design</h4>
        
        <div class="section">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photon mapping turns ray tracing into a two-stage process. First, photons are fired from each light source into
            the scene, and their interactions/bounces with different objects are stored in the photon map. The idea here is to have a 3D map of where
            the light energy in the scene is going. In the second stage, ray tracing is performed as normal. An extra lighting calculation is added
            to account for possible global illumination or caustics at the point by querying the photon map.
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photon mapping is, almost by definition, very inefficient, since one fires photons randomly throughout a scene 
            in hopes that they will be useful during the later ray tracing stage. Surprisingly, it's not the photon map creation that's a performance
            problem, but rather using the photon map during the second stage. (I've actually already glossed over at least one optimization technique
            in this description that I will discuss as future work). Luckily, "correctness" is not of particular concern when it comes to design,
            since ray tracing attempts only to approximate reality rather than get it right. As such, most of my effort was directed towards optimizing
            the major performance bottleneck: querying the photon maps.
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jansen recommends, and I used, a kd-tree for implementing photon maps. Put simply, a kd-tree is a type of
            spatial-indexing data structure that is able to take irregularly organized points in space (in this case, points photons bounce of off
            while moving around the scene) and produce a balanced tree to store them, dropping access times from O(n) to O(lg n) (as an aside, I also
            used a kd-tree to index the shapes present in the scene and it produced the largest speedup of any optimizations I tried).
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jansen is also a big advocate of other optimizations such as Ward's irradiance caching (dramatically reducing the
            number of times the photon maps are queried), but I chose not to implement these due to their relative complexity and the fact that I
            had managed to get run times low enough for my test scenes.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following 12 pictures illustrate all the features I have implemented so far in the program, arranged in
            increasing order of complexity (approximately; this is a subjective measure) and culminating with global illumination and caustics, which
            were my focus for this project. The scene is the same each time.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two features which are not visible here but are crucial to rendering complex scenes in reasonable times are support
            for networking multiple computers to work on one image and multithreading the process on each client computer.
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My work for this project (culminating in the production of images like figures 11 and 12) led to mixed results.
            There is certainly some level of global illumination and caustics, but compared to many images on the internet the effects seemed weak
            and spotty -- there's a lot of noise in the lighting produced by the photon maps which is not seen in many example images (such as those
            in Jensen's papers on the subject). It seems that I have, to some extent, misunderstood some of the calculations involved in using photon
            maps and ended up with something close but not quite right.
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, most of the groundwork for expanding upon photon mapping has already been laid in my implementation of
            the kd-tree and photon shooting stage. Actually using the photon maps during the second stage is relatively easy and is certainly where
            the problem lies.

        <h4>Future Work</h4>

        <div class="section">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, I fully intend to repair my global illumination and caustics lighting calculations. I did
            not realize until too late that the calculations were not as I had understood. I would have liked to have a more correct version of the
            algorithm to show, but unfortunately the literature is quite involved and I didn't have the time nor the background for it.
            
            <br><br>
            
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving along to features that I simply have not implemented: there are an innumerable number of extensions to
            a ray tracer, because a ray tracer provides an excellent framework to connect many different specialized techniques. There are several
            that have caught my interest in particular and I intend to implement them once global illumination and caustics are working correctly. 
            There are, of course, many optimizations that can be made to the photon mapping algorithm at both an algorithmic level (e.g. the 
            aforementioned  irradiance caching, or a technique called "importance sampling" that tries to intelligently fire photons to areas of the 
            scene where they will be most helpful) and implementation level (e.g. reducing the memory footprint for faster access). Among new features 
            I would like to support are texture mapping, more primitive shapes (perhaps complex arbitrary surfaces) and depth of field (focal blur).
